Acronym HH *in the context of TL-2* means "combined libraries \[and collections\] of the Harvard University Herbaria ([[Collection A|A]] and [[Collection GH|GH]])", Cambridge, U.S.A.

Currently Harvard University Herbaria ([[Collection A|A]], [[Collection AMES|AMES]], [[Collection ECON|ECON]], [[Collection FH|FH]], [[Collection GH|GH]]) are administered as a single unit, but materials from them should be cited separately.

**NB**: Index Herbariorum currently uses acronym HH for Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonia Peruana.
