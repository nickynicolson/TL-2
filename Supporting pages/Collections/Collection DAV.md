AHUC intercalated with DAV, but should still be cited as AHUC. Number of specimens cited for DAV includes AHUC and DAVH. DAV named John M. Tucker Herbarium in 1986; however the consolidated herbaria (DAV, AHUC, and DAVH) are now known as UC Davis Center for Plant Diversity. Library includes botanical libraries of J. Tucker, B. Crampton, J. Major, L. C. Wheeler, and G. L. Webster. PLEASE NOTE that in general DAV is no longer accepting unsolicited exchange, however, we are interested in new weeds of the U.S., rare plants of California, and other species that would help complete our collections. Please inquire in advance if you wish to send specimens.
