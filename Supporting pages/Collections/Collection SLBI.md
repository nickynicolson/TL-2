 The SLBI herbarium remains in much the same state as it did,  a few specimens of phanerogams have been added to it; most of the British & Irish phanerogamic collections have been digitised for inclusion in Herbaria@Home, and a start has been made at databasing the crytopgamic groups, commencing with the lichens.
