In 1996 it was transferred to the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), and became restricted to Fungi. Mosses and liverworts were integrated to the ROM Vascular Plant Herbarium (TRT) while algae remained with the University of Toronto Culture Collection (UTCC). In 2022, ROM management eliminated the TRTC Curator position while maintaining a Collection Manager.
