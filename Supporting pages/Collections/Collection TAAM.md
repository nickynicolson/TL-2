About one third of the collections is regional (Estonian), most specimens have been collected in field trips in Russia (incl. Siberia and Far East), Middle Asian and Caucasian republics. Many collections of Hymenomycetes and Discomycetes. Partly databased (as a part of the Estonian joint database of fungal collections and literature data maintained in and continued by the Museum of Natural History of the Tartu University).
