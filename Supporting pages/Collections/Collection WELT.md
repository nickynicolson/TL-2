**Notes**: New Zealand moved into its COVID traffic light system on Friday 3rd December 2021. This means that all New Zealand herbaria will be open to receive parcels from overseas institutions. WELT's outgoing loan programme will now consider overseas loans on a case by case basis, depending on country and the state of services operational at the time of the request.

Incoming parcel reception and outgoing consignments could change if there is an outbreak of a new strain of COVID-19.
