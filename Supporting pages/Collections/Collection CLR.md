**Current status**: Temporarily closed

**Notes**: Updated March 2017 (Status: Temporarily closed).  

Colchester Museums are currently undertaking a major collections project that will relocate our existing premises to our off-site store north of Colchester. This is a fantastic opportunity to combine our collections and enhance access to them in a new facility. 
 
This is a massive task, requiring the movement and documentation of tens of thousands of objects, and you will appreciate in the meantime we have suspended access to the collections. This suspension also includes all loans from the museum and all new donations or acquisition of objects. 
 
We hope to resume access in early 2018.
