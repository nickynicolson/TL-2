BE is not an "official" herbarium acronym, and usually it is not present in the lists of collections. In the context of TL-2 it almost surely means Burgerbibliothek Bern (Bern, Switzerland) which holds a herbarium of Felix Platter (1536-1614), one of the oldest herbaria in the world. See confirmation of location [at the website of Burgerbibliothek Bern](https://www.burgerbib.ch/de/bestaende/privatarchive/einzelstuecke/platter-herbarium). Platter's herbarium is also attributed to [[Collection BERN|BERN]] â€“ an independent herbarium.
