**Notes**: In Uzbekistan, rich herbarium collections of extant plants as well as a valuable palaeobotanical collection have been gathered since the first herbarium of this region was founded in 1920. Prior to 1988, these collections were housed at the Tashkent State University (TAK), the Tashkent Pedagogic Institute, the Nature Museum of Uzbekistan (RNMUT), the former Samarkand State University, and the Institutes of Botany (TASH), of Microbiology (TASM), and of Chemistry of Plant Materials, belonging to the Academy of Sciences of the Republic Uzbekistan. In 1988 these herbaria were combined as the Central Herbarium of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic Uzbekistan and housed at the Botanical Institute. The acronym T ASH is to be used for the Central Herbarium.
