**Notes**: Updated Aug 2017 (specimen total and staff). Since 1951, POM and RSA have been housed together at RSA; since 1966 the two collections have been fully integrated. Total number of specimens for RSA reflects combined holdings of the integrated collections. A loan request to either institution is considered also as a request to the other. Specimens from Pomona College Herbarium should be cited as POM. Macrofungi, algae, lichens, and bryophytes from RSA and POM (about 25 000 specimens) transferred to LAM, from where they were transferred to UC. Contact Andrew S. Doran, andrewdoran@berkeley.edu. R. K. Benjamin research specimens of Laboulbeniales and zygomycetes transferred to FH. RSA ancillary collections include 37 000 cones and fruit, wood blocks, wood and pollen slides.
