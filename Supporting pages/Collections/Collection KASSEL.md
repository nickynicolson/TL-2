**Notes**: KASSEL presently inaccessible; the position of botanical curator has not been filled since 1982. G. Follmann lichens (15 000 specimens) collected before 1982, including much Chilean material, housed here.  Editor's note: The date given for the establishment of this herbarium is somewhat misleading.  The Museum holds the  Caspar Ratzenberger Herbarium which includes approximately 700 pressed specimens preserved in leather-bound volumes between 1533-- 1603.  The plants were collected during a trip to France and Italy during the time when Ratzenberger was a student at Witenberg..
