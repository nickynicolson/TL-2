In June 2018, the NSW Government  announced a $60 million investment for a new facility  in Western Sydney at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan. This project has seen a purpose-built, state-of-the-art facility created to protect our nationally and internationally significant collection, recently valued at $300 million. The herbarium collection was moved here in 2022.
 
A mass digitization project was undertaken between 2019 and 2021 and has produced more than one million high resolution images of the botanical collections, most of which are publically available.
