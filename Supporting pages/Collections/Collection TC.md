**Code**: [TC](https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium-details/?irn=262679)

**Organization**: National Botanical Garden of Türkiye

**Department**: Department of Collection

**Location**: ANKARA, Çankaya, Turkey

**Total number of specimens**: 1350

**Current status**: Active

**Date founded**: 2020

**Notes**: Entered Aug 2022.  The National Herbarium of Türkiye was established in 2020 within the National Botanical Garden of Türkiye, which is a Governmental Institute. The material capacity is more than 3 million. However, because it is newly established, the current number of material is so below its capacity. The herbarium is the first as a Governmental Herbarium and has the biggest capacity in the country. As it is a Governmental Herbarium, we would like to get the code TC which is the abbreviation of Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (Republic of Türkiye). 
We will be really glad, if we can get the code TC for our National Herbarium. 
Sincerely.
