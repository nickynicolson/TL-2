**Notes**: Updated Jul 2017 (geocoordinates updated).  30 000 bryophytes and lichens of KRA on permanent loan to KRAM. Private herbarium of Jan Kornas and Anna Medwecka-Kornas (40 000 specimens) stored at KRA.  There are preserved also two historical herbaria of 18th century. The first is a book of 27 sheets (24,5 x 40 cm) with 172 specimens of plants labelled with pre-Linnean latin names. It was made by an unknown author after 1700. The second herbarium consists of four unified folio volumes (32 x 44,5 cm). The volume 1 includes 104 sheets, vol. 2 - 98, vol. 3 - 100, vol. 4 - 104 sheets and the herbarium contains 383 species of plants. After the title page the owner of the herbarium was ANDRZEJ BADURSKI (1740-1789), lecturer of medicine at Cracow University, educated at the University of Bologna. The herbarium was probably made under the supervision of GAETANO LORENZO MONTI (1712-1797), professor of medical botany at Bologna University.  The Paleobotanical collection, of the  Paleobotanic Museum , has a rich collection of over 150 thousand specimens of fossil plants (including microscopic preparations of the anatomy of certain plants) from all geological periods of Earth's history, from the Devonian period of the Holocene. The oldest exhibits date from the late XIX century (M. RACIBORSKI). One of the most valuable is a collection of Devonian first land plants. In the collection, there are several types of plants from the Devonian and Carboniferous period
