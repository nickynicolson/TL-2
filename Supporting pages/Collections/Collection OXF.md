**Notes**: Updated Jan 2014. The Fielding Herbarium contains all non-British material collected by former Department of Botany staff since 1769, and since it was largely obtained through purchase of material at auctions in the early 19th century, it is particularly rich in type material. The Druce Herbarium contains all British phanerogams that were collected later than 1769.  The history of OXF has been comprehensively studied by H. M. Clokie (1964;  An account of the herbaria of the Department of Botany in the University of Oxford," Oxford University Press).
