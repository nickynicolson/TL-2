The Stellenbosch University Herbarium has been downscaled, now only to include historical collections of southern African Pelargonium and Zygophyllum. These collections include many type specimens. In addition there is a regional (Stellenbosch area) collection which is maintained but not expanded. For the rest, the herbarium is dedicated to the research collections of current staff of Department of Botany and Zoology at Stellenbosch University.

There is no curator. Prof. L Dreyer overseas the academic management of the herbarium, and Me. Law-Brown takes care of physical curation of the regional and specialist collections. Each academic staff member curates and maintains their own research collections.
