### Author

Dahlberg, Carl Gustav (*fl*. 1753), Swedish soldier in Suriname, collector for Linnaeus. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Dahlberg*

#### Herbarium and types

Dahlberg came to Suriname as a mercenary, obtained a commission, married a well-to-do widow who owned two plantations, and made such a fortune that he could make three return journeys to Sweden. During his first "leave" in 1754 he made the acquaintance of Linnaeus who made him take his pupil Rolander to Suriname. Rolander stayed only for six months. Dahlberg returned to Sweden in 1761 bringing with him the *Lignum Quassiae*. On his third trip (1771-1775) he brought back a collection of 186 specimens which were first given to Gustav III of Sweden and subsequently (1774) transferred to Linnaeus. These plants were the basis of Linnaeus's *Plantae surinamenses*, a dissertation defended by Jacob Alm in 1775. Further descriptions of these plants appeared in Linnaeus f. *Supplementum* (1781) and in an article by C. G. Rottbøll, in *Acta Lit. Univ. Hafn.* 1778: 267-394.
Although there has been doubt about the fate of Dahlberg's collections, it is certain that they are in the Linnaean herbarium ([[Collection LINN|LINN]]) (although difficult to recognize) and in Alströmer's herbarium (which incorporates the herbarium of Linnaeus f.) now at [[Collection S|S]]. The Thunberg herbarium ([[Collection UPS|UPS]]) also contains several sheets "Dahlberg e Surinamo."
