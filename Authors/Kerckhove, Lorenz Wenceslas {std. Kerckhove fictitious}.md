### Author

Kerckhove, Lorenz Wenceslas (1785-1839) \[fictitious\] Dutch botanist. 
**Abbreviated name**: *==Name in the standard form is not specified==.*

#### Note

Created by an anonymous contributor to Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography (ca. 1890). See Barnhart, J. New York Bot. Gard. 20: 173-174. 1919. Reported to have travelled in Central America and the United States, to have been professor of natural history at Leiden, and to have published e.g. *Surinam in Bildern und Skizzen* (1835) and *Historia plantarum circa Havana sponte crescentium*, (3 vols. Amsterdam 1839). Wholly fictitious. A mixture of rich imagination with details reminiscent of Kappler, Kerchove and Humboldt.
