### Author

Dale, Samuel (1659-1739), English physician and apothecary who practised at Braintree, Essex from 1680. Friend of Ray and Joseph Andrews. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Dale*

#### Herbarium and types

Dale owned an herbarium made by Ray: it was bequeathed by him with his own herbarium to the Apothecaries Company. Both herbaria were transferred to the [[Collection BM|BM]] in 1862. Dale's herbarium was rich in British plants, but included also some specimens collected in the Bahama Islands in 1730-1732 by Francis Dale, and some from South Carolina collected in 1730 by Thomas Dale. Several plants collected by the Dales were sent by him to Sloane, Buddie and Sherard.
