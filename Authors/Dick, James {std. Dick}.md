### Author

Dick, James (x-1775), Swiss amateur botanist who collected widely in Switzerland, and who was acquainted with A. von Haller. (*Dick*).

#### Herbarium and types

The Dick herbarium was acquired by Sir Joseph Banks through William Pitcairn and is now at [[Collection BM|BM]]. The specimens in the Thunberg herbarium ([[Collection UPS|UPS]]) labelled "Dick e Helvetia" are evidently duplicates from the Banks herbarium.
