### Author

Boccone, Paolo (later Silvio) (1633-1704), Italian botanist of the grand-duke of Tuscany, professor of Botany at Padua, who collected in Italy, Sicily, Corsica (1677), Malta and travelled in western Europe. (*Boccone*).

#### Herbarium and types

The following herbaria are known to exist:
1. Two volumes in the Imperial Library of Vienna (letter from Moretti to Carlo Vittadini, publ. in *Minerva Ticinese* of 1830 (cited by Penzig 1889). Dedicated to the Austrian emperor Leopold I (1640-1705).
2. *Reliquiae horti sicci ligustici*, plants from Genova, collected 1676, now at [[Collection BOLO|BOLO]], *cf. * Bertoloni (1856).
3. Three Boccone herbaria at Paris ([[Collection P|P]]) of which one (1677) contains the types of the *Icones et descriptiones variorum plantarum Siciliae, Melitae, Juliae et Italiae* 1674 (1684), *cf*. E. Bonnet (1883). The second herbarium (1677) is also from Italy, the third, dedicated to the Prince of Condé (Louis II) (1621-1686), contains plants from Chantilly. The dedication suggests that the herbarium was made after 1675, the date of retirement of Condé to Chantilly, but it is dated 1671. The Condé natural history cabinet, with the Boccone herbaria was confiscated by the Convention in 1793 and transferred to the new Muséum.
4. *Studio de piante rare, e curiose per scuola e modello perpetuo* dedicated to queen Christina of Sweden, dated 1678, now at [[Collection GE|GE]], *cf* O. Penzig (1889).
5. The so-called Gaston d'Orléans herbarium at [[Collection P|P]] (113 plants) was also made by Boccone (in the years 1675-1700), *cf*. E. Bonnet (1889) \[Gaston d'Orléans, 1608-1660, was the third son of Henri IV\]. One volume, 38 1/2 × 24 cm., 116 p., 113 plants (orig. 114). The plants are from Italy and Sicily and were collected around 1660.
6. Other sets of Boccone plants are at [[Collection L|L]], [[Collection LY|LY]] and [[Collection OXF|OXF]] (in the Sherard herbarium).
