### Author

Ghini, Luca (1490-1556), Italian physician and botanist. (*Ghini*).

#### Herbarium and types

During the time of Ghini's teaching at Bologna and Pisa the art of making herbaria was developed. Ghini himself did *not* make a herbarium although it is likely that he sent dried plants to several of his pupils and colleagues, e.g. to Aldrovandi and Matthioli. His teaching of botany was based on demonstrations with living plants in the botanic garden, not on books by classical authors. Ghini is known to have collected in Elba and in the Tuscan and Bolognese Appenines.
