#### Note

N. contributed nearly a hundred orchidologieal papers to the *Victorian Naturalist* and other journals. He started an iconography of Australian orchids in 1923. Publication of his *Orchids of Australia* (in 20 parts of 24 plates each) was started at Melbourne in 1951 but the book ran only to four such parts (1951-1958) and was then discontinued for lack of sales. The full set of 476 water-colours was published on 26 November 1969 in a single volume *Orchids of Australia* (see Stafleu 1970 and HR).
