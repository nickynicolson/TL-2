### Author

De Ville, Jean Baptiste (*fl*. 1689); De Ville, Nicolas (*fl*. 1707), French publishers. 
**Abbreviated name**: *De Ville*

#### Herbarium and types

The De Ville's were the editors, who abstracted the following work from Bauhin's Pinax and probably also from Bauhin and Cherler's Historia; it is unlikely that they had a herbarium.

### Publications

##### n.1426. Histoire des plantes de l'Europe

**Title**
*Histoire des plantes de l'Europe* et des plus usitées qui viennent d'Asie, d'Afrique, d'Amérique,... Divisée en deux tomes & rangée suivant l'ordre du Pinax de Gaspard Bauhin. Lyon 1680, 2 vols. Oct.
**Abbreviated title**: *Hist. pl. Europe*.

**Notes**
*Publ*.: Known as "Le petit Bauhin." Jackson (p. 225) mentions a Spanish version of 1718. Unchanged reprints were issued in 1753 and 1766. The 1753 edition must be considered as having been published before 1 May 1753 until the contrary is shown (the privilège is dated 15 Oct 1751). The 1766 edition cannot be ignored. However, it is improbable that this edition contains many names that would disturb current nomenclature. Gilibert (cf. no. 2016) published a new edition in Lyon (1798) with Linnaean equivalents. Pritzel mentions the following editions:
- Chez Jean Baptiste de Ville, Lyon 1670 (n.v.), 1680, 1683, 2 vols. Oct.; 1689, 2 vols. Duod.
- Chez Nicolas de Ville, Lyon 1707, 2 vols. Oct.; 1716, 2 vols. Oct.; 1719, 2 vols. Oct.; 1726, 2 vols. Oct.
- Chez Duplain, Lyon 1737, 2 vols. Oct., 1753 Oct., 1766 Oct.
