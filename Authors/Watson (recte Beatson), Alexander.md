### Author

Watson \[recte: Beatson\], Alexander (1759-1833), Scottish soldier, governor of St. Helena 1808-1813. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Beatson*

#### Herbarium and types

Unknown.

#### Note

The inclusion of Alexander "Watson" and his *Flora S*ta *Helenica*, St. Helena (printed by J. Boyd) 1825 in some bibliographies is an error for Alexander Beatson (see TL-2/1: 155) and his *Tracts relative to the Island of St. Helena*, which contains an appendix 1, *An alphabetical list of plants* seen by Dr Roxburgh growing on the island of St. Helena in 1813-1814. Turrill (1949) has shown that the anonymous St. Helena pamphlet of 1825 is a reprint of Roxburgh's list (TL-2/9723). The pagination of the *Flora S*ta *Helenica* is \[i\*\], \[i\]-v, \[vi\], \[1\]-20. *Copies*: G, HH, K. â€“ The copy at G has a handwritten note on the title-page "From Brigadier General Alexander Watson..."
*Ref*.: Turrill, W.B., Kew Bull. 1948: 358-362. 1949 (survey lit. bot. St. Helena; on identity of Alexander "Watson").
