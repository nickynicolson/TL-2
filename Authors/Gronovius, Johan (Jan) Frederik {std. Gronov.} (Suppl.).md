### Author

\* Gronovius, Johan \[Jan\] Frederik (1690-1762). No description provided. (*Gronov.*).

#### Note

Earlier (TL-2/1: 1012)
it was stated that Gronovius was baptized in Leiden on 10 Feb 1686 and that the birth year, 1690, often given, is erroneous. In those days, the date of birth was not considered as important as the date of baptism, many babies not surviving to baptism. Often the birth date was not recorded but the date of baptism usually was. Possibly Gronovious was born in 1686 and was baptized in 1690. However, it could just as well be that he was born before 1686 and was baptized 10 Feb 1686. Only study of the original documents can establish the facts. \[DHN\]
