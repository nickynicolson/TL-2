Vol. 2, part 5 was completed posthumously from Fitzgerald's notes by Henry Deane in 1894. The contents of all parts are listed on the back wrappers of 2(4) and 2(5); these lists contain one or two name-changes not given elsewhere in the book. The drawings are all by Fitzgerald, almost invariably from fresh specimens; the lithographs are by A. J.
Stopps. Complete Copies of the book are now very rare (*Copy*: US).
