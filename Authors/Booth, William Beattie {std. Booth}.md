A second volume was in preparation (GF p. 50; announcement of vol. 2, part 1 in Loudon, Gard. Mag. 13(86): 222-223. Mai 1837), but never appeared. Four plates in a cover, numbered 41-44 with text p. \[1-8\], entitled "Illustrations and descriptions... vol. 2, part 1," dated 1837, are at HU; they are described by Quinby (1952) as "possibly a trial issue"; Loudon's Gard. Mag. 13(86):of Mai 1837, however, reviews this part. The 40 plates (36 copper engravings, 4 lithographs) are by Alfred Chandler. Three states are known, with uncoloured, coloured and highly finished coloured plates ("pulcherrimae!" PR). *Copy*: HU.
