# TL-2 vault for Obsidian

This is a digital version of **Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications and collections with dates, commentaries and types, ed. 2** (usually abbreviated **TL-2**). It is presented as folder-based database (aka "vault") for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and can be viewed either online (https://tl2.io) or used offline from your own Obsidian installation.

## Setting up offline

1. Install Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/download
2. Download this repository and unzip it in a preferred location.
3. Open Obsidian. On the first launch it will ask for action – select "Open folder as vault" and navigate to the folder you specified above. If you already have some another vault opened, click on small "Open another vault" button in bottom left corner, as in the screenshot below. After that the setup is done.

## Tips

Note that Obsidian have two modes: editing and viewing, toggled with a button on upper right.

If you do not intend to edit the content, you might want to switch default mode to "viewing" in Settings → Editor → Default view for new tabs.
